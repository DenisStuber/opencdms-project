## Climate and Hydrology Data Management System

OpenCDMS is a Reference Open Source Data Management System for atmospheric,
hydrological, marine, phenological, composition and other environmental data 
with a time-series component. It stores observational data concerning water, 
weather, hydrology and climate in a secure and flexible manner and enables 
extracting useful information from the data. 

OpenCDMS is intended to be used by the National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services (NMHS) of WMO Members, and by any others wishing to
use best-practices in managing and using these data.
