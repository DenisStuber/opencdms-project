# OpenCDMS - Climate and Hydrological Data Management System

OpenCDMS is a single-reference free open-source Climate and Hydrological Data Management System based on tested software practices.
It stores observational data concerning water, weather, hydrology and climate in a secure and flexible manner and enables
extracting useful information from the data. 

OpenCDMS is intended to be used by the National Meteorological
and Hydrological Services (NMHS) of WMO Members, and by any others wishing to use best-practices in managing and using
climate data.
